Frigate - NVR With Realtime Object Detection for IP Cameras
A complete and local NVR designed for Home Assistant with AI object detection. Uses OpenCV and Tensorflow to perform realtime object detection locally for IP cameras.

Use of a Google Coral Accelerator is optional, but highly recommended. The Coral will outperform even the best CPUs and can process 100+ FPS with very little overhead.

Tight integration with Home Assistant via a custom component
Designed to minimize resource use and maximize performance by only looking for objects when and where it is necessary
Leverages multiprocessing heavily with an emphasis on realtime over processing every frame
Uses a very low overhead motion detection to determine where to run object detection
Object detection with TensorFlow runs in separate processes for maximum FPS
Communicates over MQTT for easy integration into other systems
Records video with retention settings based on detected objects
24/7 recording
Re-streaming via RTMP to reduce the number of connections to your camera
